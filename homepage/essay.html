        <center><h1 class="display-4"><b>Brooklyn Bridge Park</b></h1></center>
            <p> 1984, when cargo operations closed, the piers that looked out onto the Manhattan skyline were going to be sold - likely to build another row of condos, or maybe a parking lot or two. However, the people of Brooklyn had other plans in mind. They were yearning for a new adventure, a space that would allow them to break free from their routines, to get a breath of real fresh air. Since 2010, Brooklyn Bridge Park has shaped the lives of many. As the young park grows, so does its population and diversity - its everlasting influx of people creates an ever-growing community.
            </p>
            <p>Brooklyn Bridge Park is home to many. “Home” is a word that means different things to different people, especially in New York City. To most, home is physical - a brownstone, or maybe an old Victorian in the suburbs. But to me, a home is more of a feeling than anything else. I have many different homes around New York City, but Brooklyn Bridge Park is the one I seem to run back to the most, sometimes to celebrate, sometimes to mourn, and sometimes to think.
            </p>
            <p> As a person sits in the big field full of fluffy green grass, near the squeaky swings, at the playful pop-up pool, or by the carousel, they are surrounded by people. To an outsider looking at the park from a bird’s-eye view, it would look like a scattered colony of ants, all searching for something different. However, once someone becomes accustomed to the liveliness of the park, they can begin to see all of the culture and knowledge of each blending together, moving and expanding like a living thing. One also begins to notice that, despite the number of people, it’s easy to create your niche, your own safe space.
            </p>
            <p>Brooklyn Bridge Park, like the city, has two separate identities. Looking at it horizontally, everyone is jam-packed together, surrounded by buildings and busy people. However, when looked at vertically, the sky is so far up, it feels like there is an infinite amount of space. Despite the waves of people crashing into each other, there is a short moment right before the crash where everything is silent and calm. Similarly to the park, where people love to socialize, but there is a mutual understanding of boundaries among the community that allows people to have their time alone as well.
            </p>
            <p>There are many sections of Brooklyn Bridge Park, and each has its unique vibe that attracts different types of people. The first section is composed of sandboxes, swings, slides, climbing structures, and a water park. This section mostly attracts the kids and their nannies who trail behind. This is a very chaotic space, as kids love to yell and run and do everything they aren’t allowed to do at home. For those who prefer an exciting but somewhat overwhelming atmosphere, this is the place to go.
            </p>
            <p>Another section would be the soccer field, the workout equipment, and the basketball court. This is a very active space and a very social one as well. The people there enjoy doing activities together while getting a work out in. It is a very motivating and stimulating section of the community.
            </p>
            <p>Then there is pier three, which has trees, grass, and logs. This is a very calm and serene section - a place where one can be alone in their peace of mind, without being bothered by crying babies or music.
            </p>
            <p>I suppose that everyone has to leave their home eventually to go off and explore the world until they are ready to build a new home. However, for now, Brooklyn Bridge Park is my home, and I’m not ready to say goodbye just yet.
